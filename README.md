# AI Debate Simulator

*Generate dynamic debates between an optimist and a skeptic using the Gemini API.*

## Overview

The AI Debate Simulator is a Flask-based web application that uses the Gemini API to generate debates on user-provided topics. Users can input a topic (e.g., "AI in Education"), and the app creates a multi-round debate between a confident optimist and a critical skeptic. The arguments are displayed in a clean, styled interface, making it easy to explore AI-driven argumentation.

### Features
- **Topic-Based Debates**: Enter any topic to generate a debate.
- **Two Personas**: Features a confident optimist and a critical skeptic.
- **Multi-Round Debates**: Generates 3 rounds of back-and-forth arguments by default.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with HTML and CSS for a clean, responsive design.
- **Extensible**: Easily add more personas or adjust the number of rounds.
